# FirstGrails (due date : 14 oct)

## Before you run
1. Don't forget to **adapt your application.yml** to your proper configuration.<br/>
By default, we run grails on the port 8081 (line 136), and the context path is /tp (line 137).<br/>
Change the fields filePath and fileUrl of the tpgrails property (line 139) so it matches your settings.

2. You have to **add a file "default-user.jpg"** in the web server folder where the images of this project will be stored. It's the default image we use for users created in the boostrap.<br/>
You can find one in the folder "grails-app/assets/images".

## Reports and doc
- The report is the file *README.pdf*, at the root of the project.<br/>
- You will find the documentation about REST in *documentation/index.html*.<br/>
- If you ever need to install a web server, you will find instructions about Apache in *ApacheInstructions.txt*.<br/>
